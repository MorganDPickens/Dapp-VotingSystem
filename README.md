# Dapp-VotingSystem
Hello everyone, welcome to my Voting DApp between two candidates. I have them listed as candidates 1 and 2, but feel free to change them to whatever you like.

The second version it a gas optimized version
version 2 removes uint256 but instead uses unit 8 because there is only 2 canidadtes in the porgram. Using uint8 will save us gas. 
Also instead of string memory we use bytes32
